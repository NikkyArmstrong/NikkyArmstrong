Hi, I’m @NikkyArmstrong, a Lead Programmer in the games industry. Find me at [nikkyarmstrong.com](https://nikkyarmstrong.com).

In my GitHub I have:
* a text-adventure engine using exclusively TDD, and a dev blog of my progress (WIP)
* my website built in Gatsby + React (constantly being updated!)
* tutorials in Kotlin for Android apps (very WIP)
* various Godot projects including one for messing about with AI algorithms, and one which stores a Secret Santa present I built
* a basic C++ repo for C++20 and technical test practice
